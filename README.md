# DMpy

DMpy is a package for developing and fitting computational models of behaviour in decision making tasks.

Its aim is to be transparent and modular, allowing simple coding of both learning and observation models, along with
straightforward model fitting.

It aims to provide a range of model fitting techniques, including maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), maximum
a posteriori (MAP) estimation, variational Bayesian inference, and full MCMC-based sampling methods.

The code here is currently under development and is unlikely to work properly!
